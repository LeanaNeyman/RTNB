The epidermolysis bullosa had caused her skin to be very fragile and blistered. The deep red, wrinkled and thin fabric table covering beautifully mimics that of her fragile hands."

An image, beveled into the middle of the poster in glass, is of what seems to be lips with overlaid images to make it look like they are deteriorating. The exhibition focuses on subverting viewer’s perceptions of reality and offer unique interpretations of the human body."

			alt=" Two images of Camille are shown side-by-side. The left image is indicated by white bold text that it is from 2019 and the right is from 2013 (both on the bottom). Camille looks radiant and healthy with flowing blonde hair lit by the sunlight. In the right image was from when she was hospitalized and her face had become swollen from her eczema. Dots of blisters are around her forehead, eyelids, upper lip and chin. "

			alt=" Amara is cheesing with her eyes shut, nose wrinkled up, and shoulders shrugged in joy. The yellow backdrop seems to reflect her jovial energy and the yellow polka dots in her black dress. Her bangs wisp across her face, as she shows off her eczema flares along her neck, chest, and length of her arms. The eczema appears inflamed, pinkish-red, and mottled."

			alt="  An iPhone image of my eczema flare-up. My left bicep and shoulder fill the frame to show the redness mottled around my skin with the exception of the area that my arm is tattooed (centered in the image). The eczema patches appear as a salmon-red and seems to be raw skin. The tattoo is of the word “perseverance” written in thin script. There is a white wall peaking from the right behind my arm with a gold, hexagram-shaped wind chime hanging off the wall."

			<h3> I took this one year ago to send to my mom at the time of a full-body eczema flareup.</h3>
